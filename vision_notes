X - can handle this
N - too many shapes (2, 1/2)
D - disjunction (0, 1/2)
S - scale (1, 3/2)
R - rotation (0, 1/2)
T - topology (4, 0/2)
E - reflection over x-axis (0, 1/2)
F - flipping of shapes (0, 1/2)

1: X
two shapes that are either the same or different

2: X
two shapes either in the same location or slightly different locations

3: T
four shapes either in two islands of two or one island of one and one Island of three

4: T
two shapes either separate or one inside the other

5: X
four shapes either all different or 2 same / 2 same

6: X
four shapes of two different kinds, either random locations or same kind separated by same distance

7: N
six shapes either two kinds or three kinds

8: D S
two shapes [class 0: nonoverlapping, same kind different scales \/ overlapping, different]
[class 1: overlapping, same]

9: X
three shapes on a line, with either the big one in the middle or at the end

10: X
four shapes other ranged in a square or randomly

11: T
two shapes either in contact or not in contact

12:
not going to get this one

13: X
four shapes, 2/2 big/small. tell whether the two pairs of big and small have the same relative position

14: X
three shapes either arranged in a line or randomly

15: X
four shapes arranged in a square; either they're all the same shape or different shapes

16: N
six shapes. each coordinate reflected over the x-axis. either the shapes themselves are also reflected were they aren't. we can get this one for a stupid reason, eg, we will classify correctly but we will learn the wrong rule.

17:
some complicated predicate on the distances that involves a determinant

18: N E
six shapes. in one class the image is flipped over the X axis. in another class every pair of shapes shared the same y-coordinate but aren't necessarily flipped. eg, in one class, shapes come in pairs (x,y),(-x,y) and another class they come in pairs (x,y),(x',y)

19: S
two shapes; either totally different or one is just a rescaled version of the other

20: F S
two shapes; either totally different or one is the reflection of the other over the line that connects them

21: R S
two shapes; either totally different or one is both a rotation and a rescaling of the other

22: X
three shapes in a line; either all the same shape are all different shapes

23: T
three shapes; one is big the others small. [class 0: one inside, one outside] [class 1: either both inside or both outside]
