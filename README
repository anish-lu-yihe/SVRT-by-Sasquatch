Unsupervised program synthesis

The general idea is to find the most compressive representation of the data, where we consider representations that are of the form f(x_i), where f is a program to be synthesized and x_i is an unobserved argument to that program. Through some noise model, f(x_i) produces the ith observation.

Thus, we compress, or "squash" the data, hence the name Sasquatch.
